# EcoMeals
The aim of this initiative is to create an application named Orders-management to streamline food orders. We will build a back-end system using Spring Boot, termed OrderMngmtAPI, and a front-end interface with React, called OrderMngmtUI. Additionally, we will implement JSON Web Token Authentication to secure both applications.
